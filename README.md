I'm Lucas. Originally from Los Angeles, California, I'm now living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the tech industry for more than a decade, most recently as a team lead. At work I'm interested in sustainable and empathetic practices, and in my free time I'm interested in creative coding, pen plotting, and most recently, amateur game development (heavy emphasis on "amateur").

The username `lilkraftwerk` is inspired by the "Lil" from Lil Wayne and the German band Kraftwerk. Strangely enough I picked this username long before I knew I'd be moving to Germany. 

I write a blog and have a list of projects I've worked on at my personal website, [lucasquinn.com](https://lucasquinn.com). If you'd like to chat about something, please feel free to ping me on Twitter at [@nah_solo](https://twitter.com/nah_solo).
