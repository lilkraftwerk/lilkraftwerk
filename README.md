I'm Lucas. Originally from Los Angeles, California, I'm now living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the tech industry for more than a decade, most recently as a frontend developer and dev team lead. At work I'm interested in sustainable, empathetic, and people-first practices, and in my free time I'm interested in creative coding, pen plotting, and most recently, amateur game development (heavy emphasis on "amateur"). I also like dogs, roller coasters, and caesar salads a lot. Did you know the Caesar salad was invented by Caesar Cardini in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1924? 

The username `lilkraftwerk` is inspired by the "Lil" from Lil Wayne and the German band Kraftwerk. Strangely enough I picked this username long before I knew I'd be moving to Germany. 

I write a blog and have a list of projects I've worked on at my personal website, [lucasquinn.com](https://lucasquinn.com). If you'd like to chat about something, please feel free to ping me on Twitter at [@nah_solo](https://twitter.com/nah_solo).
