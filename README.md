Hello and welcome to my Github. Originally from Los Angeles, California, I'm now living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the tech industry for more than a decade, most recently as a frontend developer and dev team lead. At work I'm interested in sustainable, empathetic, and people-first dev practices, and in my free time I'm interested in creative coding, pen plotting, and most recently, amateur game development.

The username `lilkraftwerk` comes from a combination of two of my favorite artists, Lil Wayne and Kraftwerk, and I use Bulbasaur as my avatar because he's number one in both my heart and on the Pok√©dex.

I write a blog and have a list of projects I've worked on at my personal website, [lucasquinn.com](https://lucasquinn.com). If you'd like to chat about something, please feel free to ping me on Twitter at [@nah_solo](https://twitter.com/nah_solo).
